One of the most interesting things that could happen in alternative gravity
theories is nonperturbative phenomena with neutron stars. In a class of
scalar-tensor gravity (STG), the Damour & Esposito-Farese (DEF) theory,
interesting strong-field scalarization happens. It happens for solitary neutron
stars, as well as for binary neutron stars. 

- The former is called ''spontaneous scalarization''. When the compactness of a
  neutron star reaches a critical point, there could be a sudden increase in
  the deviation to the general relativity. If the neutron star is put in a
  relativistic neutron star -- white dwarf binary system, a dipole radiation
  occurs, which could be studied by precision pulsar timing experiments.

- The latter is called ''dynamical scalarization''. When the compactness of a
  binary neutron star reaches a critical point, the orbital dynamics change
  significantly with respect to the general relativity, leading to a faster
  merge. This might be studied when binary neutron stars are observed with
  ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.

Norbert brought an idea that these two phenomena could be looked into together
with pulsar timing and ground-based laser-interferometer detectors. Together
with Noah & Alessandra from AEI-Potsdam, and Michael & Norbert from MPIfR-Bonn,
we look into more details.

- First, we used a handful of best timed binary pulsars, with the technique of
  Markov-chain Monte Carlo, we obtained the best limit ever from pulsar timing,
  for a variety of equations of state for nuclear matter of neutron stars.

- Then we asked ourselves, ''whether neutron stars can still be scalarized in
  presence of these limits?'' We found that, depending on the equation of state
  of neutron stars, they can still have a rather large deviation from the
  general relativity.

- We asked another question, ''whether laser interferometers can improve these
  limits?'' Using the Fisher matrix analysis, we found that using the inspiral
  of binary neutron stars, the Advanced LIGO might improve these limits only if
  suitable systems are observed *plus* neutron stars are described by certain
  equations of state. We also found that for future detectors, the Cosmic
  Explorer and the Einstein Telescope, there are more possibilities to probe
  the parameter space.

- Lastly, we investigated the phenomenon of dynamical scalarization with binary
  neutron stars from the Advanced LIGO detector. We found that this phenomenon
  might be observed only if suitable systems are observed *plus* neutron stars
  are described by certain equations of state. 

There will be more interesting interactions in testing the strong-field gravity
with pulsar timing experiments and laser interferometers in the near future. We
are looking forward to it!
