Whitehead proposed an interesting gravity theory in 1920s, shortly after
Einstein's construction of general relativity (GR). Like Einstein's GR,
Whitehead's theory has no free parameter, and it is even considered more
beautiful than GR from philosophical viewpoint. However, this theory was
falsified since 1970s by many empirical evidence. Gibbons and Will even have an
article ["On the multiple deaths of Whitehead's theory of
gravity"](https://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0611006) in 2008, that nicely reviews the
history and status of Whitehead's theory.

In Whitehead's theory, one difference from GR is that, it predicts
position-dependent gravitational interaction at the post-Newtonian level.
State-of-the-art constraint on this phenomenon came from [the spin evolution of
solitary pulsars](https://arxiv.org/abs/1307.2637).

The nature of this position dependence can be encoded into a three-body
interaction Lagrangian. The triple pulsar [PSR
J0337+1715](https://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0535) turns out an interesting
laboratory to test it. PSR J0337+1715 was proposed to be a superb object to
test the universality of free fall as well (see also [this
post](http://friendshao.github.io/news/2016/03/14/triple-pulsar-tests-mass-triplets.html)).
Detailed analysis show that the triple pulsar could already constitute an
independent test to falsify Whitehead's theory; the results are to be published
in Classical and Quantum Gravity (see [arXiv preprint
here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06535)). 

The test from the triple pulsar has some distict advantages over previous test.
It is a direct test (opposing to a probabilistic test); it involves a dynamical
3-body system; and it has a self-gravitating strong-field neutron star.
Therefore, it might add to new constraints for some specific formulation of
gravity.
