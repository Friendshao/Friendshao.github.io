A while ago, I introduced the "Gravitational Scalarization" in [this
post](http://friendshao.github.io/news/2017/04/26/gravitational-scalarizations.html).
In short, scalarization is a nonperturbative strong-field phenomenon that
happens in neutron stars if gravitation is described by a specific class of
scalar-tensor theories. It is very interesting because, while satisfying all
stringent tests of the weak-field Solar System, the theory still allows neutron
stars to have O(1) deviation from Einstein's general relativity. The
detectability of such a deviation was investigated in detail in [Shao et al.
2017, PRX (in press)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.07561).

Now, in [a new publication that Noah, Jan and I coauthored (PRD, in
press)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08285), we studied the scalarization
phenomenon from an effective action. The effective action is a coarse, yet
simple, way to capture the physics behind a fundamental action which is
computationally difficult to work out all details. Very surprisingly, our
"coarse" way of describing binary neutron stars in merge fits to numerical
simulation extremely well. The action can also be used to calculate a full
waveform model for gravitational-wave detectors on earth. This is an
interesting achievement for future tests of general relativity with the
Advanced LIGO and next-generation detectors.

In the paper, we also investigated three kinds of scalarization that exist in
the academic market within one framework. They are spontaneous scalarization,
dynamical scalarization, and induced scalarization. As pointed out earlier by
Damour and Esposito-Farese, spontaneous scalarization (that describes a single
neutron star) can be well understood in the framework of Landau's phase
transition. We found that the other two kinds of scalarization (that describe a
binary neutron star) are also described by Landau's theory, and can be
understood in a similar way. Thus, the "nonperturbative" behaviours from
scalarization is totally understandable that represents a change of sign in the
system parameter which pulls the system into another more-stable state, as what
happened in other phase-transition systems.
