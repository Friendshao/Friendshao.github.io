<big>**About Group Meetings**</big>

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with other group
members or visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to learn
different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the capability in
scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close collaborations via
inspiring discussions.

Since October 16, 2018, our group meetings take place in the meeting room on
the second floor at KIAA (location to be confirmed). To avoid conflicts with
students' classes, the time is fixed to 19:00â€”20:30.

**The Format**

0. General news (less than 5 mins)
0. Paper presentation (about 45 mins including discussions)
0. Updates on projects (indefinite time; those who are not involved are free to
  leave)

Chinese, but use English in slides.
