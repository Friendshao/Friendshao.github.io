<big>**About Group Meetings**</big>

Group meeting provides a friendly environment to interact with other group
members or visiting scholars.  It also brings the opportunity to broaden views
in science, to learn different methods in solving problems, to strengthen the
capability in scientifically sound presentations, even to develop close
collaborations via inspiring discussions.

Since October 16, 2018, our group meetings take place in the **meeting room on
the 2nd floor at KIAA**. To avoid conflicts with students' classes, the time is
fixed to **Tuesdays 19:00—20:30**.

**The Format**

0. General news (less than 5 mins)
0. Paper presentation (about 45 mins including discussions)
0. Updates on projects (indefinite time; those who are not involved are free to
  leave)

<big>**Paper Presentations**</big>


The presenter **MUST** inform the other group members the paper to be discussed
at least three days in advance. It is **suggested** to use English whenever
there are foreigners in the audience. Otherwise it is **suggested** to talk in
Chinese, but use English in slides.
