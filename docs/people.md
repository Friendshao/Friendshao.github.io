<big>**Welcome to Join our Research**</big>

I am interested in supervising **senior undergraduates**, and **graduates at
all levels**.  Those who are good at either mathematics or computer science are
especially encouraged. Students from other universities/institutions are also
welcome.  I would also like to hire **postdoctoral researchers**. If you are
interested in gravitational physics or searching for new physics from
astrophysical observations, please send your CV and I will help you in getting
a position when available. Please contact me!

<big>[**Group Meetings**](https://friendshao.github.io/docs/meetings)</big>

Since Oct 16, 2018, our group meetings take place in the **meeting room on the
2nd floor at KIAA** on **Tuesdays 19:00—21:00**. All are welcome to attend!
