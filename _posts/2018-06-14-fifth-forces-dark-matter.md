As we know quite well that dark matter interacts with our ordinary matters
*gravitationally*. Dedicated experiments are searching for other interactions
(if any) between the dark matter and the Standard Model of particle physics,
however, none was found yet.

Together with Norbert Wex and Michael Kramer, we proposed a new experiment to
study such a *fifth force* between dark matter and ordinary matters. Very
different from other experiments, we used celestial observation of binary
pulsars. Because of the extreme characteristics of neutron stars (large portion
of neutrons, large gravitational binding energy, etc), we succeeded to obtain a
very good limit on the possible fifth force. Loosely speaking, if there were a
long-range fifth force, it cannot be larger than 1% of the gravitational force.

Our work was published in [Physical Review
Letters](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.120.241104),
and it is highlighted by the PRL editors, and reported by various media.
