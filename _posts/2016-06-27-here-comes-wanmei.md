On the morning of June 27, Mengquan gives birth to our first baby, Wanmei Shao, in Klinikum Ernst von Bergmann, Potsdam Germany!

Both Wanmei and Mengquan are doing very well. Mengquan is amazing in giving the birth and showing her love to Wanmei. Much appreciated!

Now our lovely family has three members. Mengquan and I will take great responsibility of being parents and bringing up our little Wanmei. Wish her safe, happy, and healthy!
