As we all know, in Modern Physics, photons are massless. This has profound
implications for theoretical physics (esp. for quantum field theories).  Tests
of the ''masslessness'' of photons probe new physics beyond the standard model
of particle physics. If photons are found massive, the paradigm of physics has
to be shifted.

Fast radio bursts (FRBs), with their short duration and cosmological
propagation distance, are superb objects to look into the possible effects in
the light propagation due to a non-vanishing photon mass. Compared with other
experiments, these tests are very clean, only using the kinematics of the
propagation, therefore largely independent of the underlying theory. However,
one piece of information of FRBs is in general not possible for the test,
namely the redshift measurement (except FRB 121102). 

Together with Bing Zhang from University of Nevada (Las Vegas) and Peking
University (Beijing), we develop a Bayesian framework that allows us in a
statistically sound way to constrain the photon mass, even with those FRBs
without redshift measurement. Constraints from many FRBs can be combined
easily, and give a combined limit which is the best one purely from the
kinematics of propagation.  

The Bayesian framework we developed will be very useful when thousands of FRBs
are observed in the future, and might provide new surprise on the topic of
photon mass.

More details can be found in our paper [[arXiv:1705.01278](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.01278)].
