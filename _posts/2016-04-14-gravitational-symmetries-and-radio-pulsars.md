Symmetry is awful. Symmetry breaking adds more.

We all know that in current modern theories of physics, symmetry plays an important role, maybe more important than anything else. The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics enjoys the symmetry of SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1), while the General Relativity (GR) of gravity enjoys a full diffeomorphism symmetry of coordinate transformation. Symmetry breaking adds patterns onto the otherwise boringly symmetrical world. For example, Higgs mechanism is a mechanism where an underlying symmetry breaks into its subgroup, and brings masses to the world.

In an invited review article, Norbert and I looked into various physical components of a vital symmetry principle in GR, namely, the strong equivalence principle (SEP). By SEP, the first thing that comes to mind could be the universality of free fall for *self-gravitating* bodies, which is one of the key ingredients of SEP. Nevertheless, SEP means more than the universality of free fall. Indeed, local position invariance of gravity, and local Lorentz invariance of gravity are another two pieces of SEP that deserve a careful look. Besides these, the constancy of the gravitational constant, the spacetime translational symmetry, are important as well. Because SEP is a distinguished feature of GR, it is extremely desirable to beat it to death with our extreme tools.

One of many nice things of radio pulsars is their precision. The precision comes from long-term fine-timescale observations of pulse profiles. By taking advantage of this precision, radio pulsars can be used to test various aspects of gravity to an exquisite level. This is also true when it comes to SEP. We review quite some recent developments along the line of precision tests of different aspects of SEP with radio pulsar observations. Well-designed tests with radio pulsars turn out to be advantageous over other experiments for many tests that are discussed in the article. In the era of strong-field tests of GR, pulsars will continue to play a central role because of the intrinsically strong field carried by neutron stars.
