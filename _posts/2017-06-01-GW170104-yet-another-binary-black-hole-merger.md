LIGO detected yet another gravitational-wave event, [GW170104](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.118.221101)! 

<b>Importantly, the
search was done with the SEOBNRv4 waveform, that was developed by us in
AEI-Potsdam (see [this
post](http://friendshao.github.io/news/2016/11/14/seobnrv4-waveforms-for-aligo.html))! I am pround of it.</b>
