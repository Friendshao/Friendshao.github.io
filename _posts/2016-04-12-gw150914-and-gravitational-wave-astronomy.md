Advanced LIGO has detected gravitational waves from a merger of two black holes. It has been a piece of big news in the science community. Then, it is natural to ask, "what is the next?"

The answer is much more than that. In an invited popular science article (in Chinese) we try to explain some concepts of gravitational-wave astronomy to our Chinese readers.

LIGO and Virgo have been doing very well in opening the window to gravitational-wave observations. Nevertheless, one should never forget Weber bars that were built in many locations around the world. Although they didn't be the lucky detectors, their influence in experimental gravitational-wave community was huge. LIGO and Virgo have been benefitted from earlier attempts of Weber bars in understanding our gravitational Universe.

In the post-GW150914 era, the future of gravitational-wave astronomy is even brighter than before. Benefitting from aLIGO's achievements, Virgo, KAGRA, IndiGo, eLISA, PTAs, ET, and many other gravitational-wave observatories are destined to explore more. The dark sides of our Universe are revealing to us. Excited?!

There are also two missions that are in discussion from the Chinese side. They are called **TianQin** (天琴) and **Taiji** (太极). Both of them are space-based missions that are aiming to fly in, more or less, next decade. I heartfeltly wish them big success, and am willing to contribute without any doubt.
