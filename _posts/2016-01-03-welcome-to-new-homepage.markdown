Because the heavy unworthy effort in maintaining pure basic-`html` pages, and my deep love in the simplicity of `markdown` syntax, I decided to migrate homepage here (amazingly, together with blogs!)

For the new homepage, [`jekyll`](https://jekyllrb.com/) is being used, that allows least efforts to gain greatest flexibility --- for the record --- at the beginning of 2016 (I have no idea what is in the future of websites, but pretty sure that things get outdated easily!)

Currently i am using the default `.css` style together with `jekyll (version 3.0.1)`. It is simple and functioning. The style also gives the possibility of posting in the personal homepage.

**All in all, welcome to my new homepage `plus` blog!** It is a good start-up for the new year.

Hope i will have news to share with you, and not too lazy/busy to do bloggings.;-)
