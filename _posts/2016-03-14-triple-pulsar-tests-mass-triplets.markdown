I carried out **machine-precision three-body simulation** and **dedicated Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) parameter estimation** to study the precision of **the triple pulsar**, PSR J0337+1715, in testing **the strong equivalence principle**.

Einstein's General Relativity (GR) crucially relies on the equivalence principle that states the equality of inertial mass and gravitational mass. If the bodies under consideration are weakly self-gravitating, such an equality is called Weak Equivalence Principle (WEP). WEP was very well tested on Earth down to 1e-13. If the bodies are strongly self-gravitating, the equality is called Strong Equivalence Principle (SEP). The test of SEP is much harder than that of WEP, because of

1. the intrinsic weakness of gravity;
2. the lack of suitable systems thereof.

PSR J0337+1715 turns out one of the best testbeds for SEP. It composes of one neutron star and two white dwarfs in a hierarchical way (see the figure). If SEP is violated, the neutron star and the inner white dwarf would drop differently in the gravitational field of the outer white dwarf. Such a difference could manifest in precision pulsar timing experiments. On the other side, the non-detection of beyond-GR signal would cast stringent constraints on the possible violation of SEP.

In my work, in addition to the extensively studied violation in the equality of inertial mass and (passive) gravitational mass, the possibility of a violation in the equality of **active** gravitational mass and **passive** gravitational mass was also investigated. The latter would be the first test of such kind for pulsar timing, and also would be the first test of Newton's 3rd law (namely *"actio = reactio"*) with compact objects. Extensive simulation showed that the pulsar timing data might have a sensitivity of SEP down to 3e-8, improving current best limits by thousands to millions.
