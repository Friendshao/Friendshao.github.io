Before the Nobel prize is made for 2017, LIGO and Virgo published a
gravitational-wave event that was observed by both LIGO and Virgo. It is
(again) a binary black hole merger.

It is very significant, because it is the first time that Virgo simultaneously
and independently saw a GW event, which verifies the results by the LIGO
detector alone. Cross check is always very important in science, especially
when dealing with tiny signals and important claims.

Also, because of the Virgo detection, with triangularization, the sky
localization improves by a factor of ten. It helps electromagnetic followups.
This is extremely important for the future.
