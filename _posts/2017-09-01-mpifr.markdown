The first time I walked out of China was September 1, 2011. The flight took me
to the Bonn city in Germany where I spent two years. That was a very nice time,
and I made many friends with people in the Max Planck Institute for Radio
Astronomy (MPIfR) and the Argelander Institute for Astronomy. The period also
focused my research to pulsars and tests of general relativity since then; and
I enjoyed it.

Exactly six years later, I stepped onto the Bonn city again, as a scientific
staff in MPIfR this time. It is very nice because my family (the love and the
little) moved with me to Bonn as well. We will have a fruitful and wonderful
time, I believe!
